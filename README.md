# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Rock paper scissors is a hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors.

The earliest form of the game originated in China and was subsequently imported into Japan, where it reached its modern standardized form, before being spread throughout the world in the early 20th century.

This game is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision.

The "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game is a classic game played by people all over the world. This project aimed to create a computer-based implementation of the game using the C programming language.  

The objective of the project was to develop a game that accurately reflects the game mechanics of the original game and provides an engaging user experience. 

The project was developed using C programming language and implemented various programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and functions.  

The development process involved designing and implementing a functional user interface, incorporating game mechanics, debugging and testing.  

The game has been developed in a modular fashion to allow for easy maintenance and future development.
